# SpaceX-Launch-Success-Prediction
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to the aerospace industry — helping analyze and predict rocket launch success rates. You can extend it further using real SpaceX launch data from Kaggle.


# 🚀 SpaceX Launch Success Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a **SpaceX rocket launch** will be **successful or not**, based on parameters like payload mass, orbit type, flight number, and rocket reuse status.

It applies a **Random Forest Classifier** to learn patterns from sample launch data and make future predictions.
